   <b> <p>Hello, my name is Carlos Arjonilla and I am from Las Vegas, Nevada. Although I was born in San Diego and lived there for four years.
         I am currently a Computer Science major but am looking into Computer Engineering. 
    </p>
    <p>I am excited to take this course because I think it's really cool to create websites and apps. There are a lot of benefits to being
        able to create websites, especially in this day and age.
    </p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include playing the guitar, soccer, and video games. I also like anything robotics, and being outside.  </p>
    <p>This is my first semester on-campus and I'm looking forward to being in a spiritual enviroment where I can learn and grow with others.
       I am currently planning and preparing to serve a mission sometime around January next year.
    </p></b>
